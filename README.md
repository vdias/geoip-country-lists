# GeoIP Country Blocklists

This repository contains daily-updated IPv4 blocklists per country, extracted and derived from MaxMind's GeoLite2 Country database.

## Files

Each `.txt` file contains IPv4 CIDR blocks for the respective country code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2), one CIDR block per line. These lists are suitable for use in firewall address lists and network filtering tools.

> **Note:** Currently, only the following countries are included in this repository:  
> `CN` (China), `RU` (Russia), `IN` (India), `BR` (Brazil), `VN` (Vietnam), `IR` (Iran), `ID` (Indonesia), and `NG` (Nigeria).

## Use Cases

- MikroTik firewall address-list population
- IPTables, nftables, pf, CrowdSec and other firewall or security tools
- Network access control and geo-based filtering

## Updating

This repository is updated automatically via a scheduled script that downloads the official GeoLite2 CSV files, extracts country IP ranges, and formats them into the `.txt` files you see here.
