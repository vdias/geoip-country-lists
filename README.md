# GeoIP Country Blocklists

This repository contains daily-updated IPv4 blocklists per country, extracted and derived from MaxMind's GeoLite2 Country database.

It also includes an additional blocklist (`IPsum-Level4`) generated from the IPsum project, containing IP addresses associated with suspicious or malicious behavior.

## Files

Each `.txt` file contains IPv4 CIDR blocks for the respective country code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2), one CIDR block per line. These lists are suitable for use in firewall address lists and network filtering tools.

The IPsum-level list is stored as a MikroTik-compatible script under:

- `MK/IPsum-Level4.rsc` â€” containing `/ip firewall address-list` commands for MikroTik
- Uses the address list name `IPsum-Level4` inside the firewall rule set

> **Note:** Currently, only the following countries are included from MaxMind GeoLite2:  
> `CN` (China), `RU` (Russia), `IN` (India), `BR` (Brazil), `VN` (Vietnam), `IR` (Iran), `ID` (Indonesia), and `NG` (Nigeria).

## Use Cases

- MikroTik firewall address-list population
- IPTables, nftables, pf, CrowdSec and other firewall or security tools
- Network access control and geo-based filtering
- Supplementary IP threat intelligence via IPsum-Level4

## Updating

This repository is updated automatically via scheduled scripts:

- The GeoLite2 blocklists are generated from the official MaxMind GeoLite2 CSV files, extracting IPv4 ranges per country.
- The IPsum-Level4 blocklist is fetched from the IPsum project (level 4), converted into MikroTik RSC format, and committed if changed.
